This is my first blog post! I built this blog using:

- **[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)** for static site generation
- **Markdown** for writing posts
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting
- **GitHub Actions** for automated deployment

## Why Eleventy?

Eleventy is lightweight, flexible, and doesn't impose any framework
on your output. You get exactly the HTML you write in your templates,
nothing more.

## What's Next

I'll be writing about development, DevOps, and things I learn along
the way. Stay tuned!
